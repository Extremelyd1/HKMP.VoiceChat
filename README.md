The mod can be installed by copying the contents of the target folder to the `HKMP.VoiceChat` folder in your mods folder.
The mods folder can be found in your steam installation (Beware that these are the default locations.
Your install may be in a different location):
- **Windows**: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hollow Knight\hollow_knight_Data\Managed\Mods\HKMP`
- **Mac**: `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Hollow Knight/hollow_knight.app/`,
then click "open package contents" and `content -> resources -> data -> managed -> mods -> HKMP`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Hollow Knight/hollow_knight_Data/Managed/Mods/HKMP`
